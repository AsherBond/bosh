s3cli package
============
This package is used for communicating with s3 blobstores

The blob compiled from [bosh-s3cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-s3cli)
and hosted in an [s3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-s3cli-artifacts/s3cli-*-linux-amd64)

(see the [concourse resource](https://main.bosh-ci.cf-app.com/teams/bosh-director/pipelines/s3cli/resources/release-bucket-linux))
